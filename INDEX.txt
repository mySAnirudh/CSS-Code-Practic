  Form validation normally used to occur at the server, after the client had entered all the 
necessary data and then pressed the Submit button. If the data entered by the client was 
incorrect or was simply missing, the server would have to send all the data back to the 
client and request that the form be resubmitted with the correct information. This was 
really a lengthy process which used to put a lot of burden on the server. 
JavaScript provides a way to validate the form's data on the client's computer before 
sending it to the web server. Form validation generally performs two functions. 
 Basic Validation: First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the 
mandatory fields are filled in. It would require just a loop through each field in the 
form and check for data. 
 Data Format Validation: Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for 
correct form and value. Your code must include appropriate logic to test the 
correctness of data. 
Example 
We will take an example to understand the process of validation. Here is a simple form in 
html format.
